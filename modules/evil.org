* General Keybindings
General.el allows  us to  set keybindings.   As a  longtime Doom
Emacs user, I  have grown accustomed to using SPC  as the prefix
key.General makes setting keybindings (especially with SPC) much
easier.   All of  the keybindings  we  set later  in the  config
depend on general being loaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package general
  :config
  (general-evil-setup t))
(nvmap :states '(normal visual) :keymaps 'override :prefix "SPC"
       "SPC"   '(counsel-M-x :which-key "Counsel M-x"))
